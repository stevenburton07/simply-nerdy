Episode 42: Baldur's Gate 3 - The Revival of Classic CRPGs

Welcome to Simply Nerdy! I'm so excited to talk about Baldur's Gate 3 today. This game has been absolutely dominating my free time, and I think it represents something really special for the RPG genre.

Let's start with character creation. Oh my goodness, you can spend hours just building your character. There are so many race and class combinations, and each one feels meaningful. Whether you want to play as a Githyanki Warlock or a Half-Elf Paladin, the options are incredible. And the backgrounds aren't just flavor text - they actually affect dialogue options and how NPCs interact with you.

But what really sets this game apart are the companions. Shadowheart isn't just a cleric in your party - she's a complex character with secrets, fears, and her own arc. Astarion starts off seeming like a stereotypical vampire rogue, but there's so much depth there. Gale, Karlach, Wyll, Lae'zel - every single one of them feels like a real person with motivations and growth.

The combat system deserves special mention. It's turn-based D&D 5th edition combat, which means positioning matters, height advantage is crucial, and environmental effects can turn the tide of battle. You can shove enemies off cliffs, create surfaces with spells, or use the environment in creative ways. It's tactical without being overwhelming.

Story-wise, I don't want to spoil anything, but the choices you make actually matter. Not in that superficial way many games promise, but genuinely. Characters remember what you've done. The story branches in meaningful ways. There are entire questlines you can miss based on your decisions. It's the kind of reactivity that makes you want to replay immediately to see what you missed.

The production values are insane. The voice acting is top-tier across the board. The motion capture work makes every conversation feel cinematic. The score is beautiful. And the fact that Larian managed to make a game this massive feel polished is remarkable.

Now, it's not perfect. Some of the Act 3 content feels a bit rushed compared to the first two acts. There are still some bugs here and there. And the game is absolutely massive - we're talking 80+ hours for a single playthrough, which might be intimidating for some people.

But honestly? Those are minor complaints. Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece. It's the kind of game that reminds you why you fell in love with RPGs in the first place. If you have any interest in the genre, you owe it to yourself to play this game.

It's available on PC and PlayStation 5, and honestly, it's worth buying whatever platform you need to play it on. This is a once-in-a-generation game.

Thanks for listening to Simply Nerdy! Let me know what you think of Baldur's Gate 3 if you've played it. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

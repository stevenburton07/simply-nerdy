It runs in every browser, powers countless websites, and is used for both frontend and backend development with Node.js.</p><h2>Basic Concepts</h2><p>Let's start with the fundamentals:</p><h3>Variables</h3><p>Variables store data that you can use throughout your program. In modern JavaScript, we use <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>:</p><pre><code>let name = 'Simply Nerdy';\nconst pi = 3.14159;</code></pre><h3>Functions</h3><p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks:</p><pre><code>function greet(name) {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet('World'));</code></pre><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Once you've mastered the basics, explore DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and modern frameworks like React.</p>",

Grid makes it simple and intuitive.</p><h2>Basic Grid Structure</h2><p>Here's a simple grid container:</p><pre><code>.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  gap: 20px;\n}</code></pre><h2>Responsive Grids</h2><p>Make your grids responsive with media queries or the <code>auto-fit</code> and <code>minmax</code> functions:</p><pre><code>.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n  gap: 20px;\n}</code></pre><h2>Grid Areas</h2><p>Name your grid areas for even more control over your layout. This is especially useful for creating complex page structures.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Asynchronous programming is essential in JavaScript for handling operations like API calls, file reading, and timers without blocking the main thread.</p><h2>Promises</h2><p>Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation:</p><pre><code>fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error(error));</code></pre><h2>Async/Await</h2><p>Async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code:</p><pre><code>async function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n    const data = await response.json();\n    console.log(data);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}</code></pre><h2>Which to Use?</h2><p>Use async/await for cleaner, more readable code, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations. However, Promises are still useful for parallel operations with <code>Promise.all()</code>.</p>",

Research each to find what interests you.</p><h2>Learn the Fundamentals</h2><p>Start with the basics of programming. For web development, that means HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use free resources like freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, or MDN Web Docs.</p><h2>Build Projects</h2><p>Theory is important, but employers want to see what you can build. Create a portfolio of 3-5 projects that demonstrate your skills:</p><ul><li>A personal website</li><li>A web application with a database</li><li>An API integration project</li><li>A mobile or responsive design</li></ul><h2>Network and Apply</h2><p>Connect with other developers on Twitter, LinkedIn, and at local meetups. Apply for junior positions, internships, and apprenticeships. Don't be discouraged by rejection—it's part of the process.</p>",
